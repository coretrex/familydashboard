## Security Setup

### üîê Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase for backend services. The Firebase configuration is included directly in the HTML file, which is **safe for client-side applications**.

**Why this is secure:**
- Firebase API keys for web apps are designed to be public
- Security is enforced through Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules
- The API key alone cannot access your data without proper authentication

### Firebase Security Rules

Make sure your Firestore security rules are properly configured:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only allow authenticated users to read/write
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd family-dashboard
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or use existing one
   - Enable Authentication (Google Sign-in)
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Update the Firebase config in `index.html` with your project details

3. **Configure Firebase Security Rules**
   - In Firebase Console, go to Firestore Database
   - Set up security rules to allow authenticated users to read/write
   - Configure Authentication to allow Google Sign-in

4. **Run locally**
   ```bash
   # Using Python (if installed)
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

5. **Access the dashboard**
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
   - Sign in with Google
   - Start using your family dashboard!
